FAQ:

Q. How do I open the menu?
A. Press Q.

Q. The menu still doesn't show!
A. Press ESC or open the console to see it (yes this is annoying).

Q. Nothing happens when I try to spawn something!
A. Make sure you're pointing so that your cursor would be on the floor - the game won't spawn anything if you're pointing at a wall because it can't spawn things in a wall.
