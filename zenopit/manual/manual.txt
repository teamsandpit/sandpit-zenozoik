FAQ:

Q. How do I open the menu?
A. Press Q.

Q. The menu still doesn't show!
A. Press ESC to see it (yes this is annoying but that's all that the plugin API allows).

Q. Nothing happens when I try to spawn something!
A. Make sure you're pointing so your cursor at the floor - the game won't spawn anything if you're pointing at a wall because it can't spawn things in a wall.
